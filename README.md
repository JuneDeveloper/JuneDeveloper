## JWGardiner

Young developer who likes Java/Kotlin the most, I create mods for Minecraft and usually work on most projects on my own.

I have learnt python, and started off learning C/C++, and i'm based in the UK.

Currently working towards making my own business based around selling high quality computers throughout the UK.

I like to use fully open source licenses on my software, usually ranging between MIT and the GNU General Public Licence. The vast majority of my code is licensed under one of these 2, and all the code stored on github is open source. Non-Open source software is stored on my own server.
